# Basics of writing app module
import './App.css'

function App() {

  return (
    <div >
      <Text text="Monametsi"/>
    </div>
    //JSX yntax
    //A component - Any function in Javascript that returns some 
    //kind of JSX code.
    //They start with a capital letter. Here App is a component
    //Jsx components returns only one parent element
    //fragments are empty html elements that allows us to return multiple parent elements
  )
}

function Text({text}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello {text}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
export default App


State is something where once it is updated, 
the component will change and re render itself
to show thwe new state.

Api files seperate
It's usually a good practice to create a 
separate file that contains all of my API calls
so that I can keep all the networking operations 
or stuff related to the API in a separate file and
find it easily.

The useEffect allows me to add side effects to my
functions or to my components and define when they
should run 

A context will allow state to be globally available 
to anything that's within the provided context

Children is a reserved prop when you write a 
component and children is anything that's inside 
of the component that you rendered.

Local storage allows us to store values directly
within our browser.
